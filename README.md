What work did I do on this project?
For this project, I was given some starter code that helped set up the environment and training structure, including the Q-learning model setup and the maze logic. I used the TreasureMaze and GameExperience classes provided to define the pirate’s world and manage training data. The part I had to create and adapt myself included adjusting the training parameters, tweaking how the model updates Q-values, and ensuring the pirate agent learned to navigate the maze to reach the treasure. I also debugged issues where the agent would get stuck or not improve, and eventually tuned the training loop to produce more consistent behavior.

How does this connect to the larger field of computer science?
Throughout this course, I got a better understanding of how reinforcement learning works and how intelligent agents can solve problems by learning from trial and error. In the bigger picture, computer scientists often work on solving complex problems using logic, math, and creativity. This project shows how AI can be applied to real-world challenges like decision-making and pathfinding, which are useful in areas like robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems.

When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I try to break it into smaller steps, test different solutions, and stay persistent even when it gets frustrating. This mindset helped me troubleshoot and improve the agent’s performance by adjusting the reward system and training settings.

What are my ethical responsibilities?
As a computer scientist, I think it’s important to make sure the systems we build are safe, fair, and used in responsible ways. That includes being transparent about how AI models make decisions and thinking about how they might affect users. For example, if this kind of reinforcement learning was used in something like a self-driving car or health recommendation system, we would need to test it thoroughly and make sure it doesn’t lead to harmful or biased behavior. I’ve learned that building smart software also means thinking about the real people it could impact.
